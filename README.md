# Women's World Cup
An app that lists the matches of the Women's World Cup 2023, giving you the possiblity to schedule notifications to each match, consulting your favorite matches and filterinng the matches in the screen by stage, stadium or team.

This app is based on the one created by Digital Innovation One (DIO) team during the formation Android Experience. I added the filter and the favorite screen using Room, Navigation, Hilt and Jetpack Compose.

The original appwas themed after the Men's World Cup 2022, I adapted it to the Women's competition.

Feel free to make any suggetions!
